Our game spans across 2 dimensions the player will have to jump across in order to help close the rift that has caused this dilemma. 
Every Item you bring across with you will changein some way (An example of this would be Chemical A would turn to Chemical B). 
The player will have to do multiple tasks in order to seal the rift. The ultimate task will invole the player jumping 
across dimensions to keep the  machine sealing the dimensions in sync. 
To aid the player there will be a watch that can peak into the other dimension giving the player a preview of what they may be jumping into.
