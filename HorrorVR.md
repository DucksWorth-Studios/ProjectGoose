# Horror Elements to Consider
Three of the main elements we must focus on:

* Visuals:
Visuals are our biggest friend a user can percieve an enviroments danger/safety from a quick glance. Use this to your advantage make a place look safe to generate 
relief then immediatley turn that on its head. Make its scary and safe or just outright dangerous.

* Sounds: The right sound at the right time can create a enviroment of fear.Heavy breathing by the player character can drive up the heartrate of the user as they sense 
danger. Use sounds to the best advantage.

* Timing: Timing is everything. You must time every event in order to generate maximum effect on the player. you must give them time to cool down before scaring them 
again so must have the right balance of relief and fear.

## Immersion
All these elements are used to create a sense of immersion for the player. when a player believes they are in that world and are that character everything will impact 
heavily and can generate more fear based on their personal fear. they can fill in the blanks in their own mind and what they think may happen will always be more
than what you can make actually happen so play on immersiona nd anticipation to scare a user.
