This file contains the code structure that we must follow

Commenting Etiquette

* Place the comment on a separate line, not at the end of a line of code.
* Begin comment text with an uppercase letter.
* End comment text with a period.
* Insert one space between the comment delimiter (//) and the comment text, as shown in the following example.
* Do not create formatted blocks of asterisks around comments.

Commenting will be heavily enforced within the project we will use C# triple slash documentation. Will allow an XML documentation sheet to be developed.
