General Concept
- 8 Ball Pool
- In VR
- 2 player online/local multiplayer

Alternative Implementation:
- AI instead of multiplayer
- Use guns instead of pool cues (Should be easier to calculate physics)

Main Mechanics:
- Physics based on IRL 8 Ball Pool

Basic Mechanics:
- VR Movement
- VR Interactions
- 8 Ball Pool Physics
- VR Menus

Items to Research
- Calculating 8 ball pool physics
- Movement



Basic Concept
-------------
Our second idea is 8 Ball Pool in VR. Using Multiplayer, 2 players would 
compete using the same rules as normal 8 Ball Pool and 
would be able to interact with eachother in a 
3D environment modeled after a pool hall.



The challenges in building this game come mainly from emulating the physics of 8 Ball Pool in Unreal Enigne
