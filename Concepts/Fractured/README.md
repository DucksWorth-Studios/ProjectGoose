# Fractured

## Why VR
We want to use VR for the interactive experience that it offers the player.

We want to create a world that the player can physically interact with, physically pouring one chemical into the other, throwing random objects round the room, physically moving from space to space.

All these interactions are significantly enhanced as an experience when you put the player into a Virtual Reality that they themselves physically interact with.

## Rules
Two Dimensions. Whatever you bring from one dimension will change in the other(different ways of change).Microwave negates change

Microwave goes  one way
