# Level Design Best Practices

**Planning/Pre-production:** Have a proper plan. Have an exact map with different areas well defined and clearly thought through. Every entrance and area of the map the player can venture should be clearly marked. Mark no go zones.

**Gameplay:** Plan for your gameplay. Account for pacing, flow, and objectives. Also account for story and scripting/set pieces. These should push the layout of the level so that there is not loads of going back and forth for objectives, but also so there is enough room for player exploration.

**Visuals/Artistic styles:** The level should have a clear setting. (Lab, hell, heaven, forest etc) These will affect the overall design and art style in the level. Colours and VFX should all reflect the setting. Labs will be clean, white, and bright. Hell will red, full of lava and decay. Every choice in this area will be to make the level visually pleasing.

**Technical:** Knowledge of the software that will be used to create the level.

## Important Questions to answer before creating a game environment:

*	Is the idea worth my time?
*	Is the idea interesting and unique? Has it been done before and if yes, can I make it better?
*	Where does the environment take place? What location?
*	How am I going to pull this off? What would I need to learn and improve on?
*	What is the story of the environment? Does it make sense for the game and/or game type?
*	Is it a single player map? Multiplayer map? Standalone game environment?
*	Do I need to create custom assets such as 3d models, textures, materials, animation etc? Does the engine or the level editor come with everything I need?
*	Which game engine and level editor will I use?
*	What is the time period? Environment setting?
*	Have I done my research about the story and location I want to make?
What is the theme of the environment?
*	What is the colour palette I want to use that makes sense for the emotional impact I am trying to convey?
*	What is the top down layout and how do I create one?
*	What do I want the player to experience in this environment?
*	What are the objectives for the player to complete if any?
*	How will the flow and pacing play out in the map?
*	How will I tackle the project? What will I do during the production stages?
What is the core, the essence of the environment?
*	Have I collected photo reference for architecture, lighting, props, location and setting of the environment?
*	What is the purpose of this project? Why am I working on this?
