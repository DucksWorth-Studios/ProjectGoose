# Fractured

## Basic Conecpt
Our game spans across 2 dimensions the player will have to jump across in 
order to help close the rift that has caused this dilemma. Every Item you bring across with you will change
in some way (An example of this would be Chemical A would turn to Chemical B). The player will have to do 
multiple tasks in order to seal the rift. The ultimate task will invole the player jumping across dimensions
to keep the  machine sealing the dimensions in sync. 
To aid the player there will be a watch that can peak into the other dimension giving 
the player a preview of what they may be jumping into.

## Why VR
We want to use VR for the interactive experience that it offers the player.

We want to create a world that the player can physically interact with, physically pouring one chemical into the other, throwing random objects round the room, physically moving from space to space.

All these interactions are significantly enhanced as an experience when you put the player into a Virtual Reality that they themselves physically interact with.

## Why Two Worlds
We want to make the player think outside the box in their problem solving skills.

Any object the player carries into the other world will change state. It will become corrupted like the world around it. 

The worlds will also be visually different from each other. The first world will be a clean lab environment, while the 
second world will be corrupted full of spores and decaying as a whole.

## Rules
Two Dimensions. Whatever you bring from one dimension will change in the other(different ways of change).Microwave negates change

Microwave goes  one way


## Tasks

### Task 1
Unlock the case that will contain the dimension hoping watch. This will be a brief introduction to snap zones

### Task 2
You will be immediately transported to the upside down and will have to collect a corruption sample in order to analyze it and be able to jump between dimensions

### Task 3
You will have to create a concoction to help seal the rift. Using the dimension jumpings ability to modify chemicals

### Task 4
You must jump between dimensions to keep the machine going. The machine will have a Simon says type panel where it will display the pattern and you must jump dimensions and run to the other control panel and type it in.

### Task 3 Explaination
World One:  Chemical Yellow     Chemical Red

World Two:  Nothing

Objective: Make Pink



Step 1: Mix Yellow and Red Becomes Orange

Step 2: Jump to  world Two: Orange becomes Blue

Step 3: Jump back to world one place orange into Microwave

Step 4: Jump to world 2 take orange out of microwave.

Step 5: Jump to world 1 orange is now blue.
